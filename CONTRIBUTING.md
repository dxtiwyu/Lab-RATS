# Lab-RATS: Contribution Protocol

We don't do corporate bureaucracy here. We do technical elegance and operational efficiency. If you've got a better way to bypass a sandbox, optimize a payload, or harden the stealth engine, we want it.

## 0x01: The Workflow
1. **Fork the Intel**: Clone the repo to your own workspace.
2. **Branch for Impact**: Use clean branch names like `payload/bypass-knox` or `fix/heartbeat-latency`.
3. **Commit with Logic**: No "fixed stuff" messages. Tell us what you changed and why it matters for the mission.
4. **Synchronize**: Submit a PR once your code is stable and tested.

## 0x02: Engineering Requirements
- **Stealth is Non-Negotiable**: If your code triggers a heuristic scanner or leaves "loud" logs, it’s bloatware. Fix it.
- **Resource Discipline**: Every CPU cycle counts. Minimize battery drain and network signatures.
- **Modern Hardware Focus**: Ensure compatibility with SDK 34/35/36. Legacy support is secondary to modern evasion.
- **Clean Architecture**: Follow the existing pattern of background services and dynamic handlers.

## 0x03: Submission Rules
- **Technical Proof**: If you’re adding a bypass or a new Ghost feature, include logs or visual proof of it working on real hardware (OneUI 8+ / Pixel).
- **No Ego**: If we suggest refactoring, it’s to maintain the signal-to-noise ratio. Accept the feedback and improve the code.

## 0x04: Bug Reports
If it's a standard bug, use the Issue Template. If it's a vulnerability in the protocol itself, see `SECURITY.md`.
